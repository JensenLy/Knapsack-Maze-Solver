        Solution for Task D goes here.

        Be sure to increase self.m_cellsExplored whenever you visit a NEW cell
        Be sure to increase the knapsack_value whenever you find an item and put it in your knapsack.
        You may use the maze object to check if a cell you visit has an item
        maze.m_itemParams can be used to calculate things like predicted reward, etc. But you can only use
        maze.m_items to check if your current cell contains an item (and if so, what is its weight and value)

        Code in this function will be rigorously tested. An honest but bad solution will still gain quite a few marks.
        A cheated solution will gain 0 marks for all of Task D.
